 How to Run Locally

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository (or create the files manually):
    If you were provided a repository, you would clone it. Since I'm providing individual files, you need to create the project structure described above and place the respective code into each file.

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd leo9studio-clone
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:
    This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the necessary packages (like React, React DOM, and React Scripts).
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  Start the development server:
    This command starts the React development server and opens the application in your default web browser (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

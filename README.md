# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Leo9Studio Homepage Clone (Hero Section & Navbar)

This project is a recreation of the Hero Section and Navbar of the [Leo9Studio homepage](https://leo9studio.com/) using React and pure CSS. It focuses on implementing responsive design, interactive elements, and smooth animations as per the requirements.

    -   Call-to-action buttons with hover effects.
    -   Smooth fade-in animation for the entire section on page load.
-   Pure CSS: No external UI libraries or Tailwind CSS used.
-   Modular Structure: Components and styles are separated into logical files.

Technology Stack

-   React (Created with Create React App)
-   CSS 

 How to Run Locally

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository (or create the files manually):
    If you were provided a repository, you would clone it. Since I'm providing individual files, you need to create the project structure described above and place the respective code into each file.

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd leo9studio-clone
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:
    This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the necessary packages (like React, React DOM, and React Scripts).
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  Start the development server:
    This command starts the React development server and opens the application in your default web browser (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Customization

-   Hero Background Image: Replace `src/assets/images/hero-bg.jpg` with your desired background image.
